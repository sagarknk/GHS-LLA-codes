## Data Generation

The file "generate_data.R" can generate "m" number of data sets for fixed "q" and "n",
when the true precision matrix structure is "hubs" or "random". For the minimum working
example (MWE), p=10, n=25 and we choose the "random" structure. Data sets for other 
structures can be generated by un-commenting respective lines of the code. The generated
data is stored in the directory "Data". 

## LLA under the graphical horseshoe 

Run the script "HS_LLA_all_run.m", for chosen "q" and "n" above (for data generation).
Set "prec_struc" variable in the script to 1 for "hubs" and 2 for "random". This script 
runs "CV_HS_LLA_Cauchy.m" and "CV_HS_LLA_Laplace.m" to perform 5 fold cross validation
to select the global tuning parameter under the Cauchy and Laplace mixtures and stores the 
parameters in the "Results" directory. Once done, it runs the scripts 
"Multi_start_point_Fixed_tau_HS_LLA_Cauchy.m" and "Multi_start_point_Fixed_tau_HS_LLA_Laplace.m",
to compute the precision matrix estimate with "n_EMs" number of starting points and using the 
tuning parameter computed using cross validation. The resultant estimates are stored in the
directory "Results". 

Now to get performance metrics analogous to columns one and two in Tables I, II, S.I and S.II, run the script
"Final_Analysis_HS_LLA.m". Set the mixture type Cauchy/Laplace by setting the variable "mix_type"
and set "prec_struc" variable in the script to 1 for "hubs" and 2 for "random". 

## Frequentist graphical lasso

Source the script "GLASSO.R" for chosen "q", "n", "m" and "prec_struc". Performance 
metrics analogous to columns four and five in Tables I, II, S.I and S.II, is printed 
as the output. 

## MCMC under the graphical horseshoe 

Run the script "GHS_MCMC_all_run.m" for chosen "q", "n", "m" and "prec_struc".
It calls the function "GHS.m" to run the posterior Gibbs sampler. The resultant MCMC
samples are stored in the directory "Results". To get performance metrics analogous 
to columns three in Tables I, II, S.I and S.II, run the script "GHS_MCMC_Post_processing.m".
